# Sparkfun Serial 7-SegmentDisplay Library
A Teensyduino library to drive the Sparkfun Serial 7-Segment display over I2C.

## Tests

The `tests` directory contains some unit tests for the library. These use the
[CppUTest](http://cpputest.github.io/) library. Edit the `Makefile` in the top
level to point to your local copy of CppUTest, then `make` to build and run
the tests.
